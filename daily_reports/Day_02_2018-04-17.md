Today we wanted to design a new case for the Fluorometer to takle several issues.

* Distances and angles between optical components have to be steady. 
* Distances have to be short to improve on the signal to noise ratio.
* Making it smaller in general.

We decided on a general setup. Led, sample, and detector will be in the plane of the "table" with a 90 degree angle between the three parts. As its commonly done (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoreszenzspektroskopie).

We devided the labour and designed an outer case for the MC, the electronics, and the sampleholder. And we designed a Sample holder that secures a short distances between led, sample and detector.

We did some crude ray tracing calculations and found that the lens maybe is not neccesary when the detector is close to the sample.

The laser cut plans are in files case/cad\_files/outer\_box.svg and case/cad\_files/inner\_box.svg

We also started working on porting the code to the NodeMCU, since we want to move to that platform from the previous Arduino one. We got the NodeMCU to recognize the sensor, but for reasons yet unknown, we're not getting any readings yet.
