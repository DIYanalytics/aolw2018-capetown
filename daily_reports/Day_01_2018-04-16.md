We started by writing out the tasks that we would like to accomplish in the next two weeks. We estimated the time each task would take and realized that we may have more work than we can complete in the timeframe of the workshop, so we prioritized a bit. Note that we made this assessment after positing that everything takes at least twice as long as you inititally estimated.

The mandatory tasks are as follows:

* Design next case version for 0.2ml PCR tubes as sample vessels - 4h
* Cut and assemble the case - 2h
* Design a UI/UX - 1h
* Implement UI - 8h
* Test with extracted DNA - 4h
* Thorough documentation - 16h

The optional tasks are as follows:

* Cut glass filters - 2h
* Test different filters - 2h
* Test different dyes - 2h
* NodeMCU software - 8h
* Design a measurement scheme - 2h
* Figure out (non)linearity of sensor/measurements - ?

We decided to start working today on the task "Design next case version for 0.2ml PCR tubes as sample vessels".

Modificaions will modify the design minding the following aspects:

* Simplicity while assembling
* Stability of the optical parts
* Lining up uf the optical parts
* Smarter way to fit the parts on the wood board to lasercut
* New sample vessel: the 0.2 ml PCR tube

In the next we will experiment a new way to insert opical parts from above, making them easy to remove. It consists in a some slit on the side as large as the dept of the material. The optical part is mounted on a holder, which has an hook that fits perfectly into the slit. In this way we make it easier to change optical parts during the experiment, if needed.
