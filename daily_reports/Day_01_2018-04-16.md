We started by writing out the tasks that we would like to accomplish in the next two weeks. We estimated the time each task would take and realized that we may have more work than we can complete in the timeframe of the workshop, so we prioritized a bit. Note that we made this assessment after positing that everything takes at least twice as long as you inititally estimated.

The mandatory tasks are as follows:

* Design next case version for 0.2ml PCR tubes as sample vessels - 4h
* Cut and assemble the case - 2h
* Design a UI/UX - 1h
* Implement UI - 8h
* Test with extracted DNA - 4h
* Thorough documentation - 16h

The optional tasks are as follows:

* Cut glass filters - 2h
* Test different filters - 2h
* Test different dyes - 2h
* NodeMCU software - 8h
* Design a measurement scheme - 2h
* Figure out (non)linearity of sensor/measurements - ?

We decided to start working today on the task "Design next case version for 0.2ml PCR tubes as sample vessels".
