# Plan for the day

* Finish CAD files
* Next iteration of design talk
* Fitting for LED
* Design a measurement scheme
* Research (non-)linearity of our light sensor TSL2591, and of the fluorescent dye systems we're using
* NodeMCU software
* Schedule visit to fablab for laser-cutting

# What we did today

## Cellphone-based approach

TODO Robert

## Measurement scheme

## Non-linearity and gotchas in fluorescence DNA quantification

TODO Ale or Lisa

## NodeMCU software

TODO Lisa

## CAD files

The CAD files are done now, so we are ready to go cut the case. The current version is still way bigger than necessary, because Alessandro likes big cases.

## Planning the trip to MakerStation to laser-cut the case
